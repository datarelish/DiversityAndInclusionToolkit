Diversity Charter

We believe that all members of the technical community are equally important. 
 We are part a tech community where we value a diverse network, and learn and share from one another: 
 regardless of age, 
 regardless of colour, 
 regardless of their ethnicity, 
 regardless of their religion or beliefs, 
 regardless of disability, 
 regardless of gender, 
 regardless of sexual orientation, 
 regardless of their race, 
 regardless of their ability or lack of ability, 
 regardless of nationality or accent. 
 We are a diverse tech community where we are all individuals with differences, but we are all members and we can all learn from each other.
